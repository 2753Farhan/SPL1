# SQL Injection Vulnerability Detection Project using C++

This project aims to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in a given user input for a SQL database using C++ programming language. SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into SQL statements, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even deletion of entire databases.

Step 1: Download the tool from the GitHub repository https://github.com/2753Farhan/SPL1 .
Step 2: Extract the downloaded files to a folder on your system.
Step 3: Use Code blocks or an IDE to run the project. 


## Usage

To use the tool, you will need to provide it with the web application URL you want to scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Follow the steps below to use the tool:

Step 1: Move the PHP file of the website that you want to test to the directory where you have downloaded the tool. 
Step 2: Run the project.
Step 3: Choose options about What do you want to do?
